##Overview

Nutrifacts is a web application that allows users to search for nutritional information for virtually any type of food by using a simple search query. Users can receive nutrition information for generic grocery store items, specific brand names, as well as restaurant menu items. 

The Nutrifacts search functionality utilizes the Nutritionix API, which accesses data from restaurants, packaged foods, and common foods. Users can receive nutritional information based on those parameters and save the results to their accounts.

This is my first Ruby on Rails project as a student of General Assembly's Web Develpment Immersive program.
